NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of cells in the maze.

============
  solveBfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: 
Searching path takes O(n) for worst case, 
and recording takes O(m) where m is the shortest distance
from source to destination.


============
  solveDfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: 
Same as in breath first search, but using stack instead of queue,
which takes same time complexity, so the time complexity is 
still the same.
